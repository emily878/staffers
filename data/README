This directory expects two CSV files:

staffers.csv - 
  * A row for every staffer in the system. The same staffer may appear multiple times as long as the quarter (2009Q3, 2010Q1, etc.) is different.
  * The first row should be a header of column titles.
  * Offices will be created as needed as the rows are parsed. 
    ** If a row has a bioguide_id, a member office will be created if needed, and the staffer linked to it.
    ** If a row has a committee_id, a committee office will be created if needed, and the staffer linked to it.
    ** Otherwise, a regular office will be created if needed, and the staffer linked to it.

titles.csv -
  * A row for every unique original staffer title in the system, with its accompanying standardized title.
  * The first row should be a header of column titles.
